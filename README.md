## Version Final 04/06/19
  - Updated the specifications for the homework for all screens.
    > for **980px**: not much change since my laptop is 980px screen
    > for **768px**: updated to fit all the content while maintaining an aethetic design on the 3 html files , mostly worked on portfolio.html since i have to make sure it floats to the left when the screen shrinks to 768px;
    > for **640px** : same as 768px screen , updated mostly the navbar to match the homework specifications
